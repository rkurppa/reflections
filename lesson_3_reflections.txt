When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When I want to
    - work on a repository with others
    - publish a project
    - create a non-local backup of the project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	For example, in case I am working on a feature with myself, and someone else is working
	on another feature, and then pushes his / her changes to GitHub master branch. I don't
	want to automatically load those changes to my local repository, in case they conflict
	with my changes. If I can pull manually, I also control what and when is pulled. Another
	case would be someone inserting malicious code to a project.
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead
of another?

	Fork: Copies a repository from someone else, so you can create your own changes even in
	the case where you don't have the permissions to edit the original repository.
	Clone: Copy a repository to another location where you can edit it, eg. from GitHub to
	local machine.
	Branch: Make a copy of a project so you can make changes while still enabling others to
	keep using and developing one version of the project. Can be merged back.
