When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When I want to
    - work on a repository with others
    - publish a project
    - create a non-local backup of the project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	For example, in case I am working on a feature with myself, and someone else is working
	on another feature, and then pushes his / her changes to GitHub master branch. I don't
	want to automatically load those changes to my local repository, in case they conflict
	with my changes. If I can pull manually, I also control what and when is pulled. Another
	case would be someone inserting malicious code to a project.
